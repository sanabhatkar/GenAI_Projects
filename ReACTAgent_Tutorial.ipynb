      "Summary: Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating the nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the Indian Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect. India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience led by Indian National Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi who adopted these values from one of the early movements in India led by Ram Singh Kuka (quoted in one of the letters by Shaheed Bhagat Singh referring Guru Ram Singh as his Dada Guru).\n",
      "Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which British India was divided into the Dominions of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence. On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each subsequent Independence Day, the incumbent Prime Minister customarily raises the flag and gives an address to the nation. The entire event is broadcast by Doordarshan, India's national broadcaster, and usually begins with the shehnai music of Ustad Bismillah Khan. Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting ceremonies, parades and cultural events. It is a national holiday.\n",

      "Summary: The Interim Government of India, also known as the Provisional Government of India, formed on 2  September 1946 from the newly elected Constituent Assembly of India, had the task of assisting the transition of British India to independence. It remained in place until 15 August 1947, the date of the independence (and partition) of British India, and the creation of the dominions of India and Pakistan.\n",

      "Page: List of sovereign states by date of formation\n",
      "Summary: Below is a list of sovereign states with the dates of their formation (date of their independence or of their constitution), sorted by continent.\n",
      "This list includes the 195 states which are currently member states of the United Nations or non-member observer states with the United Nations General Assembly. This does not include extinct states, but does include several states with limited recognition.\n",
      "For proposed states or various indigenous nations which consider themselves still under occupation, see list of active autonomist and secessionist movements.\n",
      "Nation-building is a long evolutionary process, and in most cases the date of a country's \"formation\" cannot be objectively determined; e.g., the fact that England and France were sovereign kingdoms on equal footing in the medieval period does not prejudice the fact that England is not now a sovereign state (having passed sovereignty to Great Britain in 1707), while France is a Republic founded in 1870 (though the term France generally refers to the current French Fifth Republic government, formed in 1958).\n",
      "Around 60 countries gained independence from the United Kingdom throughout its history, the most in the world, followed by with around 40 countries that gained independence from France throughout its history. Over 50% of the world's borders today, were drawn as a result of British and French imperialism.\n",
